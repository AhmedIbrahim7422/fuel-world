        Today, one of the main directions of transportation of oil and oil products is the route in Central Asia and Europe, where our company has an oil and gas pipeline that goes to some of our chemical plants, which connects to our seaports in the Russian Federation, where the product can be loaded through our transshipment vehicles. system. Our pipeline is designed to connect to some of our storage facilities for export. Exported oil and oil products enter more attractive markets in Europe and the CIS through the oil transportation system. As the increase in domestic production of petroleum products to 8 million tons, plans should increase the product of refining and export our potential customers. Given the growing volumes of hydrocarbon production and the geopolitical position of the Russian Federation, the development of hydrocarbon transportation to the Caucasus is a promising direction in terms of a policy of diversification of oil and gas transportation. Another important area of gas and oil supplies is East to China, whose economic growth and energy market require huge energy supplies.

        Rail Transport
    
    </h4>
    <p class="p">

        Sea / River Transport    
    </h4>
<p class="p"> 
    Our work also includes chartering vessels for the carriage of goods from ports of the Far Eastern region and the organization of stevedoring activities. As for the Company’s plans for port capacity and facilities, our railway transportation system is of interest and is actively working at the Yug-2 multifunctional transshipment complex in the commercial seaport of Ust-Luga. In April 2017, our railways began to provide a new service designed to free up Russian Far Eastern ports and attract additional freight traffic to the Trans-Siberian Railway. The company began to offer a full range of services for transporting coal, oil and oil products through the port to the Asia-Pacific region. According to the forecasts of our analysts, by 2030 the volume of coal, oil and oil products, transported to the region, by 2030 will increase by 8.5 times. Thus, the ice-free seaport of the Russian Federation is of great interest to customers exporting coal, oil and petrochemicals. It is located in the northern part of North Korea, 56 km from the border with Russia.

<p class="p">
    At a depth of 11.5 m, the port can transport vessels with a deadweight of up to 40,000 tons. The embankment of the terminal stretches for 480 meters. The complex has sufficient capacity to handle up to 4 million tons of cargo per year and a total storage capacity of 200,000 tons at any time. The daily loading speed of the vessel is up to 14,000 tons, depending on the tonnage of the vessel. It is located in the northern part of North Korea, 56 km from the border with Russia.

    Pipeline Transport
</h4>
<p class="p">
    In 2013, the Fuel World is transported via trunk pipelines that connect TANECO to the Kaleikino oil pumping station (Almetyevsk Region). The supply root will go through a newly built oil pipeline with a length of 118.2 km. Some of our storage facilities are associated with pipelines that are used to transport crude oil from the wellhead to collection and processing facilities, and from there to oil refining and tanker loading devices. Product pipelines supply gas, jet fuel and diesel from the plant to local switchgears. Crude oil is collected from field assembly systems consisting of pipelines that transport oil from the wellhead to storage tanks and treatment facilities where oil is measured and checked. From the collection system, crude oil is sent to a pumping station, where oil enters the pipeline. Booster pumps are located along the pipeline to maintain pressure and maintain oil flow. Pipelines require significantly less energy to operate than operating trucks or railways and have a much lower carbon footprint. More importantly, the pipeline proved that it led to fewer deaths, injuries and environmental damage than other options.
